## Session Log

### Entry 1: Project Initialization
**Time**: 2025-12-02T03:37:25.874Z
**Phase**: Bootstrap

**What I'm doing**:
Initializing the SPECTRE ARCHITECT project structure and documentation system. Creating the foundational files and directories for a procedural world generation system with MCP protocol support and live web visualization.

**Decisions made**:
- Starting with comprehensive TODO list to track multi-phase project
- Creating all directories and files as specified in the architecture overview
- Using Python FastAPI for server with async WebSocket support
- Implementing Three.js for web-based 3D visualization
- Following SPARC framework with boomerang delegation pattern

**Challenges**:
- Complex multi-component system requiring careful orchestration
- Need to ensure MCP protocol compatibility with Kilo Code
- Real-time WebSocket broadcasting for live updates

**Next steps**:
- Create complete project structure
- Initialize build diary and documentation
- Implement core terrain generation
- Build server architecture
- Create web visualization interface
- Implement MCP tools
- Test full integration
